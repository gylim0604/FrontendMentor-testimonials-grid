## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

IT was my first time using nth-child. Although I understood the concept of it, I never used it before this. An example of it would be as such: 

```html
<div class="card">
  ...
</div>
<div class="card">
  ...
</div>
<div class="card">
  ...
</div>
```
```css
.card:nth-child(1){
  ...
}
```
Where we would select the first card class only.
